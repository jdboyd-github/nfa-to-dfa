# nfa-to-dfa
## Overview
A program which will accept as its input a file name, of which contains a textual representation of an NFA, and converts the NFA to the resulting DFA. Project for Theory of Computation (CSCI-3660).

## Features
* Accept inputs from a file and parses information.
* Given an NFA, creates the resulting DFA.

## Source Files
`NFAConvert.java` Java souruce file that performs all program logic. Inputs a filename as input, input.txt.

`input.txt` A text file that includes relative informatiion for building the NFA, including Q (States), Sigma, F (Final State), Q0 (Initial State), and Delta (Transitions). Formatting must be constant when changing values.

## Development
### Developer
Program created and built by [Daniel Boyd](https://github.com/jdboyd-github).

### Languages and Technologies<br>
`Eclipse IDE` for all programming and project development.
`Java` used for all programming logic.
